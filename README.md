Here's an example `README.md` file for your Node.js and Express application that includes setting up the environment, running the application, and using the API:


# Card Help Center API

This is a simple API for managing cards in a help center. The API is built using Node.js, Express.js, and MongoDB (with Mongoose ORM). It includes endpoints for creating, retrieving, and searching cards based on their titles.

## Installation

1. **Clone the repository:**

   ```bash
   git clone https://github.com/shubham-chhimpa-here/Abstract_help_center.git
   cd Abstract_help_center
   ```

2. **Install dependencies:**

   Make sure you have [Node.js](https://nodejs.org/) and [npm](https://www.npmjs.com/) installed.

   ```bash
   npm install
   ```

3. **Set up environment variables:**

   Copy the `.env.example` file to `.env` and fill in the required environment variables.

   ```bash
   cp .env.example .env
   ```

   Then, open `.env` and fill in your specific values:

   ```dotenv
   DB_URI=mongodb://localhost:27017/yourDatabaseName
   PORT=3000
   ```

4. **Start the server:**

   ```bash
   npm run dev
   ```

   The server will start on the port specified in your `.env` file (default is `3000`).

## Usage

### Running the Application

- To start the application in development mode:

  ```bash
  npm run dev
  ```

- To start the application in production mode:

  ```bash
  npm run start
  ```

The API will be accessible at `http://localhost:3000` by default.

### MongoDB Connection

Make sure MongoDB is installed and running on your machine, or use a cloud-based MongoDB service like [MongoDB Atlas](https://www.mongodb.com/cloud/atlas). Update the `DB_URI` in the `.env` file with your MongoDB connection string.

## API Endpoints

### 1. Check Server Status

- **Endpoint**: `GET /ping`
- **Description**: Checks if the server is running.
- **Response**: `pong`

### 2. Create a Card

## Environment Variables

The following environment variables need to be set in your `.env` file:

- `DB_URI`: The MongoDB connection string.
- `PORT`: The port on which the server will run (default: 3000).

Example `.env` file:

```dotenv
DB_URI=mongodb://localhost:27017/yourDatabaseName
PORT=3000
```



```
